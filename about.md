Hello! My name is Nikita Shmakov, I'm 27. I live in the most beatiful city in Russia - Saint Petersburg. I'm a Software Engineer, love Clean Code and TDD, interested in Java (Groovy, Scala, Kotlin) backend development. My hobbies are guitar playing, astronomical observations, video games, music, popular science and fiction literature reading.
