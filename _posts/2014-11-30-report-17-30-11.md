A couple of months ago, I came up with the idea: to stop working and do some self-education in subjects like literature, philosophy, history, math and physics. And I've done this - two weeks ago I quit one of the best russian IT company, Yandex. I decided to study every day on weekdays, to run in park every 2-3 days and to maintain a report with Google Docs.

On a first day, I studied up to 3 a.m. It was a sunny day with the great opportunity for observations of the Sun through a telescope. It was absolutely amazing! :) You can see the spots on the Sun with your own eyes! In the evening I watched [Pléyades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) and [Orion Nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula).

### Literature/Philosophy
Over the 2 weeks I read [The Spire by William Golding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spire), [The Gadfly by Ethel Lilian Voynich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gadfly), [Fear and Trembling by Søren Kierkegaard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling), 2 novels of Gabriels Garsija Markess and complete reading of [The Universe Within by Neil Shubin](http://www.amazon.com/The-Universe-Within-History-Human/dp/0307473279). In the future, I will focus on the more philosophical literature which is difficult to read on weekdays, so the next monday I will start to read [The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain).

### History
I started with history of Russia. As a person with left-winged politic views I am most interested in history of USSR, but began from Novgorodskaya Rus' anyway. On the last session I was reading about Catherine I and Peter II (XVIII century).

### Math/Physics
I engaged by the book on theoretical mechanics by [Leonard Susskind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind). It contains simple explanations of mathematical and physical concepts and exercises for each subject. At the moment I remembered trigonometry, vectors, differential and integral calculus, curve tracing, dynamics and some other physical subjects and concepts.

### Running activities
My current total run for this 2 weeks is about 24 km. Now in Saint Petersburg quite cold (from -5 to -10 C), thus it becomes more difficult (and lazier :)).

### Programming
I completed 7th and 8th weeks of Introduction to logic on Coursera. Also I was trying to learn Cryptography but realized that it's not interesting for me right now. Next week on Coursera starts Data analysis courses, will deal with them too.

Here is a brief what I did the previous two weeks. Maybe I will write more reports, stay tuned :)
